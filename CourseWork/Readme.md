# CourseWork
Web application for managing students and courses.

#### 1 Setup solution
1.1 ASP.net Core with full .NET Framework.

1.2 Remove production CSS and JS. It's confusing for now.

1.3. Remove contact and about pages. It makes to much noise.

1.4 Update bootstrap to version 3.3.7 and include bootswatch themes with version 3.3.7+2 to solution. 

Can search for packages at https://bower.io/

Use bower to add front end dependencies.
bower.json is visible only after all files in folder are visible. Consider using file explorer to locate bower.json which is in the root of web project.

Look how wwwroot/lib folder grows...

1.5 Include bootswatch theme CSS in HTML head.

1.6 Put two links that look like a button on home page.
